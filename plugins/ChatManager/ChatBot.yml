#                                 Main Configuration of Chat Bot
#=================================================================================================#
#
#    1. This feature you can create trigger messages that will activate the chat bot, and the bot will
#    respond with your bot response.
#
#    2. You can execute commands just encase you need to for any reason.
#
#    3. You can have a required permission so if the player doesn't have the correct permission
#    the bot will not do anything towards that player or rank.
